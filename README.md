If you want to use this create an index.txt file with a sequence of paths to your files each on a new line in the order you wish them to be included in your final presentation.

Then use with this file in the directory.

```bash
python -m multi_rise --index=index2.txt --output=output.ipynb
```


This only works on python 3.4+.
